# Project Title: Car Price Prediction Analysis Using Python Libraries.
              This is a python analysis on Jupyter notebook using Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib


### Data Source:
              This project is a Kaggle Car Prices Prediction dataset.


### Project Description: 
               In this project, I took help from Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib to create amazing visualizations.
               This project predicts the price of cars using their features. The project reads car prices prediction data
               from an Excel file, processes it, and then generates visualizations to analyze the data.
                     
### Execution: 
               In the course of this project, 
                     . I imported my Libraries: import pandas as pd
                                                import numpy as np
                                                import seaborn as sns
                                                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                                                %matplotlib inline
                                                sns.set(color_codes=True)
                    
                     . Imported my dataset: car = pd.read_csv('CarPricesPrediction.csv') 
                    
                     . Explored my dataset: my dataset has 1000 rows and 7 columns
                    
                     . Cleaned and Prepared my dataset: Dropped irrelevant columns, renaming the column names,
                                                        dropping duplicate rows and missing values etc.
                    
                     . Visualized my dataset: 
                                Some of the data visualized are as follows:
                                       . visualized the distribution of the car prices
                                       . Found the outliers
                                       . Found the number of cars per make
                                       . Found the relationship between the relations
                                       . Analyzed the features of the cars mileage
                                       . Analzed the manufacturing years of the cars
                                       . Analyzed the prices of cars across the years they were manufactured
                                       . Analyzed the features of the car conditions
                                       . Analyzed the Models of the car brands

### Conclusion: In conclusion, prices of cars manufactured varied across the years. With 2011 being the highest price in production and 2022 the least.Â¶
                With Ultima and Camry been the most produced car models.
